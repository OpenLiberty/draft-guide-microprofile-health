= Adding health reporting to a microservice

Learn how to provide and check the health of a microservice using MicroProfile Health.

// =================================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use Microprofile Health feature to report the health of
a RESTful application. The great benefit from adding a health check is that it helps in machine to
machine communications, monitoring and knowing which services are performing in the application.

A health check is a method for assessing the states of the services in an application to know the overall performance. The state of a service is either `UP` or `DOWN`.
When the state is `UP`, the service is available. However, when it is `DOWN`, the service
is currently not available (i.e. in maintenance). The overall outcome of the application is `UP` only when the checks of all the services are `UP`. 

The MicroProfile Health feature provides an endpoint that you can get the health check results as a JSON object. This HTTP request endpoint returns a status code of `200` if the application outcome is `UP`, otherwise, a status code of `503` if it is `DOWN`.

You will add health checks to report the states of the `PropertiesResource` and `InventoryResource`
RESTful services in an inventory management application. This application and the two services in it are provided for you in this guide. If you want to learn how to create a RESTful application, see 
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service].

// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

// include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the git repository and use the starting project
that is provided in the `start` directory. To do this, run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-mp-health.git
cd guide-mp-health/start
----

// =================================================================================================
// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished 
health check implementation for the services in the application. Feel free to give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to MicroProfile Health Check endpoint: `\http://localhost:9080/health`. From here, you can see the health of the two services as well as the overall health outcome of the applicaiton. As shown, there are two checks. One that shows the state of `PropertiesResource` service and the other shows the state of `InventoryResource` service. They are both in `UP` state as you may expect and because of that the overall outcome of the application is `UP`. 

You can also verify states of the two RESTful services by pointing to their endpoints:
- http://localhost:9080/system/properties refers to the PropertiesResource service that retrieves the information for a specific host
- http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts refers to the InventoryResource service that retrieves the information for a list of all previously registered hosts

Once you are done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding health check to inventory application
// =================================================================================================

== Adding health check to inventory application

Begin by enabling the MicroProfile Health feature in your `pom.xml` file. This feature allows you to
use the MicroProfile Health API to provide health checks to your RESTful services.

Navigate to the start/pom.xml file and add the required dependency:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=health]
----

Proceed with the two sections below to add health checks to `PropertiesResource` and
`InventoryResource` services.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding health check to PropertiesResource service
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding health check to PropertiesResource service

Create `PropertiesHealth.java` class in `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/` to report the health of the PropertiesResource service. 

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/PropertiesHealth.java[tags=PropertiesHealth]
----

The `org.eclipse.microprofile` package contains the required MicroProfile Health Check classes.

The `@Health` annotation indicates that this class will be read for reporting the state of
a desired service to `/health` endpoint. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is
required because the health check service must stay active within the lifetime of the application for the
state to be reported.

This class implements the `HealthCheck` interface, which means you must override the `call()`
method from this interface.

The healthy state of the `PropertiesResource` service is simulated by reading the system property of the
host. If the system property `wlp.server.name` is `defaultServer`, then the state is `UP`, otherwise, it
is `DOWN`.

Lastly, you need to pass the service name `PropertiesResource` as an argument to the `named()`
method to indicate that this is the service being reported.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding health check to InventoryResource service
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding health check to InventoryResource service

Create a class `InventoryHealth.java` in `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/` to report the health of the InventoryResource service.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java[tags=InventoryHealth]
----

This service reports its healthy state depending on two conditions:

1. A property of type boolean found in `/start/CustomConfigSource.json`. This property is used this file to manipulate on the state of the service. This file is provided for you in this guide. If you want to learn how to configure this file, see https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-microprofile-config[Configuring Microservices using MicroProfile Config].

    "io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance": false 

2. `PropertiesResource` service availability (i.e. returns 200 response code).

As you can see, adding health check to this service is similar as in the previous section above.
However, there are minor adjustments and additions.

The `@Inject` annotation is used to initialize the `InventoryConfig` object. This object will allow
you to read the property in the `CustomConfigSource.json` file. You can learn more about the `@Inject` annotation from
https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-rest-cdi[Handling dependencies with RESTful web services].

The `isHealthy()` method returns a boolean that determines the health of `InventoryResource` service.
It checkes the two conditions that were mentioned above. This method is used as the condition in `call()` method. The state of `InventoryResource` service is `UP` if `isHealthy` returns `true` and vice versa.

Now, open `InventoryResource` in `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/` to add a condition to this service.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=InventoryResource]
----

The service reports the system properties for a hostname through calling
`getPropertiesForHost()` method. This can only happen if the `io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance` configuration is set to `false`. Otherwise the service responds with the message, `Service is temporarily down for maintenance`. If the service reports the system properties as desired, then the health of this service is `UP`. If the service is down for maintenance, then its health is `DOWN'. With this condtion set on the service, the second condition in the `isHealthy()` method of the `InventoryHealth` class is relying on it. 

The same condition is applied for the `listContents()` method in this service. This method lists the stored hosts.

The `serviceInMaintenance()` method from the class `JsonMessages` is provided for
you to be used in this guide. To learn more about this class, read
https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-microprofile-config[Configuring Microservices using MicroProfile Config].
This method is used in this class to respond a Json Object containing a message telling the user
that the service is currently down for maintenance. You just need to pass the name of the service to it.

// =================================================================================================
// Building and running the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

To build the application, run the Maven install goal from the command line:

  mvn install

This goal builds the application and creates a .war file in the target directory. The goal also
configures and installs Open Liberty into the target/liberty/wlp directory.

Next, run the Maven liberty:start-server goal:

  mvn liberty:start-server

This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven pom.xml is already configured to
start the application in this server instance.

Once the server is running, you can find the health endpoint
reporting the state of the two services at the following URL:

* `\http://localhost:9080/health`

Now, try to turn the `InventoryResource` service down (i.e. in maintenance) by changing the
property `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` value to `true`. This property is found in
`/finish/CustomConfigSource.json`. Refresh the browser. You will see the state of the
`InventoryResource` is currently `DOWN` and because of that the overall outcome is `DOWN`. You can
verify that by pointing your browser to the inventory service endpoint. As you can see, the service is responding
with a message telling you that it is in maintenance.

If you make changes to the code, use the Maven package goal to rebuild the application and have
the running Open Liberty server pick them up automatically:

  mvn package

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven liberty:stop-server goal:

  mvn liberty:stop-server

// =================================================================================================
// Testing Services States
// =================================================================================================

== Testing Services States

You will write two test methods `testIfServicesStatesUp()` and `testIfInventoryTemporarilyDown()` to
validate the state of `PropertiesResource` and `InventoryResource` services. You will also use a
test helper class `HealthTestUtil` that is already provided for you to perform these two tests.

Begin by creating a test class src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/HealthTest.java[tags=HealthTest]
----

The @Before and @After annotations are placed on methods that execute before and after every test
case. These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks.
In this case, the `setup()` method initializes the fields. They are the `JsonArray` that hold the states
of the services, the two maps for storing the states when the services are up and when they are
down and the constant to hold the property that will be read. `The teardown()` method simply resets
the property's value.

There are few test case methods annotated with `@Test` to test the functionality of the inventory
application after adding health checks.

* The `testIfApplicationIsUp()` method checks if the application outcome is currently `UP`. This means both services' healthy states are `UP`.  This test uses these helper methods:

    *** `connectToHealthEnpoint()` method sends a request to `\http://localhost:9080/health` then
    verifies the `200` response code is returned. This method also reads the response as `JsonArray` which contains the states
    of the two services. The `JsonArray` is used to compare with the expected service states. 

    *** `getActualState()` method returns the state (`UP` or `DOWN`) of a specific service
    from the `JsonArray` object that is passed as an argument to it.
    
    *** `checkServicesStates()` method verifies and asserts the actual states of both services.

* The `testIfInventoryServiceIsDown()` method follows the similar procedure as in the previous test
case. It first checks if the application outcome is `UP`. Next, the `io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance` property value is changed from `false` to `true` in the `CustomConfigSource.json` file. With the property update, we send a request to check the health outcome again. This time the expected code should be 503. Lastly, we validate the state of the `InventoryResource` service by asserting if
it is `DOWN` but the `ProeprtiesResource` service is `UP`.

=== Running the tests

Go to `start` directory and run `mvn clean install`. You should see two tests pass with the following
results:

```
