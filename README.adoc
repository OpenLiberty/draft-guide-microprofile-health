= Adding health reporting to a microservice

Learn how to report the states of RESTful services in an application using MicroProfile Health API.

// =================================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to add a health check using Microprofile Health API to report the health of
a RESTful service. The great benefit from adding a health check is that it helps in machine to
machine communications, monitoring and knowing which services are performing in the application.

A health check is a method for assessing the states of RESTful services to know the overall
application performance. The state of a RESTful service is either `UP` or `DOWN`.
When the state is `UP`, the service is currently available. However, when it is `DOWN`, the service
is currently not available (i.e. on maintenance). The health check outcome for all of the services
in the application is `UP` if all services are up. Otherwise, if any service is down, the outcome
is `DOWN` and the response code will be `503`.

You will use MicroProfile Health API to report the states of `InventoryResource` and `PropertiesResource`
RESTful services. Then you will write tests to validate the states of these services.

You can find the health check results which contain the states of the two services above at
this endpoint:
```
http://localhost:9080/health
```
You can also find the two RESTful services that already made up for you from here:
```
http://localhost:9080/system/properties
```
```
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
```

Note:

*  You can learn how to create the made up endpoints, `/system/properties` and `/inventory/hosts`,
from https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-rest-cdi[REST-CDI] guide.

// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

// include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the git repository and use the starting project
that is provided in the `start` directory. To do this, run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-mp-health.git
cd guide-mp-health/start
----

// =================================================================================================
// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished inventory application with Microprofile Health API implemented. Feel free to give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to `\http://localhost:9080/health`. From here, you can see the health of the
services. As shown, there are two checks. One that shows the state of `InventoryResource` and
the other which shows the state of `PropertiesResource`. They are both in `UP` state as you might
expected and because of that the overall outcome is `UP`. You can verify that by pointing to one of the
services.

Once you are done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

// Adding MicroProfile Health API
// =================================================================================================

== Adding MicroProfile Health API

You will make the two services,`PropertiesResource` and `InventoryResource`, report their state
using MicroProfile Health API.

Start by adding the MicroProfile API for health check in your `pom.xml` found in `start` directory:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=health]
----

// =================================================================================================
// Reporting PropertiesResource State
// =================================================================================================

=== Reporting PropertiesResource State

Create a class `PropertiesHealth.java` in `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/`
and import Microprofile Health:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/PropertiesHealth.java[tags=healthAPI]
----

Modify the class to implement `HealthCheck` interface.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/PropertiesHealth.java[tags=PropertiesHealth]
----

Add `@Health` annotation to indicate that this class will be read for reporting the state of
a desired service to `/health` endpoint. Add `@ApplicationScoped` annotation which is
required because the service must stay active within the lifetime of the application for the
state to be reported.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/PropertiesHealth.java[tags=requiredAnnotation]
----

Override `call()` method from `HealthCheck` interface to make it simulate the response
(i.e. the state) to be up if the system property `wlp.server.name` is the `defaultServer`.
Otherwise, set the state to be down. In addition, pass the service name to
`named()` method to know which service is being reported.

----

// =================================================================================================
// Reporting InventoryResource State
// =================================================================================================

=== Reporting InventoryResource State

You will make this service report its state depending on:

1. A property of type boolean found in `/start/CustomConfigSource.json`:

    "io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance": false

2. `PropertiesResource` service availability (i.e. returns 200 response code).

Create a class `InventoryHealth.java` in `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/`
and follow the steps in the previous section above to add MicroProfile health check. However, Implement
`HealthCheckResponse` as the following:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java[tags=HealthCheckResponse]
----

Define `isHealthy()` to return a boolean that will decide the state of `InventoryResource` in
`HealthCheckResponse()`. Make it read that property using `InventoryConfig` object and check if
`PropertiesResource` is available.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java[tags=isHealthy]
----

Inject the `InventoryConfig` object:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java[tags=config]
----

Open `InventoryResource` in `/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/` and
handle the service to indicate that it is on maintenance when its state is `DOWN`. Otherwise,
make the service function normally when it is `UP`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=listContents]
----

Make sure you import `JsonMessages` to `InventoryResource`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=JsonMessages]
----

Create `serviceInMaintenance()` in `JsonMessages` and make it return `JsonObject` with the a message:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/common/JsonMessages.java[tags=serviceInMaintenance]
----

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the application
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the application

To see the new application in action, run `mvn clean install` first and then `mvn liberty:start-server`
from `start` directory. Once the server is running, you can find the Microprofile Health endpoint
reporting the state of the two services at the following URL:

* `\http://localhost:9080/health`

Now, try to make the `InventoryResource` service in maintenance (i.e. temporarily down) by changing the
property `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` value to `true` found under
`/finish/CustomConfigSource.json`. Refresh the browser. You will see the state of the
`InventoryResource` is currently `DOWN` and because of that the overall outcome is `DOWN`. You can
verify that by point your browser to inventory service. As you can see, the service is responding
with a message telling you that it is in maintenance.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing Services States
// =================================================================================================

== Testing Services States

You will write two test methods `testIfServicesStatesUp()` and `testIfInventoryTemporarilyDown()` to
validate the state of `PropertiesResource` and `InventoryResource` services. But before that, you
will need to create a test helper class to perform these two tests.

Create the test helper class `HealthTestUtil` in `/start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health`.

Create `connectToHealthEnpoint()` method and make it send a request to `\http://localhost:9080/health` then
check the `200` response code and read the response as `JsonArray` which contains the states
of the two services.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTestUtil.java[tags=connectToHealthEnpoint]
----

Create `getActualState()` method and make it return the state of a specific service from the `JsonArray` object.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTestUtil.java[tags=getActualState]
----

Create `changeInventoryProperty()` method and make it read `CustomConfigSource.json` file and
change the property's value:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTestUtil.java[tags=changeInventoryProperty]
----

Create `cleanUp()` method to reset the property to its original value.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTestUtil.java[tags=cleanUp]
----

Now, create the test class `HealthTest` in `/start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health` then add
the `setup()` method. Make it initialize the data needed for the two tests. Add `@Before` annotation it.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=data]
----

Create `testIfServicesStatesUp()`. Add `@Test` annotation to it. Make it check if both services are
currently `UP` using the helper methods you just created.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=testIfServicesStatesUp]
----

Create `testIfInventoryTemporarilyDown()` method. Follow the same procedure as in
`testIfServicesStatesUp()` method. However, make it send another request after changing the
property's value, `inMaintenance`, from `false` to `true` . Then make it validate the state of the
service `InventoryResource` by asserting if it is `DOWN` and the other service is `UP`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=testIfInventoryTemporarilyDown]
----

Write `checkServicesStates()` method. Make it check and assert the actual states of both services
using the helper methods.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=checkServicesStates]
----

Add `teardown()` method with `@After` annotation to make the helper method `cleanUp()` reset the property.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=After]
----

=== Running the tests

Go to `start` directory and run `mvn clean install`. You should see two tests pass with the following
results:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
