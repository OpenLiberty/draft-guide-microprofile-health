= Adding health reports to a microservice

Youâ€™ll explore how to check the health of a microservice with MicroProfile Health.

// =================================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use the MicroProfile Health feature to report the health of
a RESTful application. A health check allows your RESTful
service to participate in the decision-making process about its health.

The MicroProfile Health feature provides an endpoint that includes the health check results as a
JSON object. This HTTP request endpoint returns a status code of `200` if the application outcome
is `UP`. Otherwise, the endpoint returns a status code of `503` if the application outcome is `DOWN`.

Use the health check to assess the state of a service in an application. The state of a service
is either `UP` or `DOWN`. When the state is `UP`, the service is available.
When the state is `DOWN`, the service is either unavailable or in maintenance.
The overall outcome of the application is `UP` only when the checks of all the services are `UP`.
A service orchestrator can use a `DOWN` result to determine when to replace an instance of a service.

Before the service reports its state, it checks what it needs to make available. Depending on
what the service has or what is provided to it, it can use the MicroProfile Health API implementation to report whether it is healthy or not. A self-check can be anything that is related to the
service, such as a dependency, a successful connection to an endpoint, a system property, a database, or another availability
of resources.

You will add health checks to report the states of the `system` and `inventory`
RESTful services in an inventory manager application. This application and the services in it
are provided for you. To learn how to create a RESTful application, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service].

After you start the application, you can access the microservices to test their availability:

* The `http://localhost:9080/system/properties` microservice retrieves the information for a specific host.

* The `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` microservice retrieves the information for a list of all previously registered hosts.

// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

Run the following commands to clone the Git repository and use the starting project
that is provided in the `start` directory:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-microprofile-health.git
cd draft-guide-microprofile-health/start
----

// =================================================================================================
// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root file contains the finished
health check implementation for the services in the application. You can try out the application before
you build your own.

To try the application, navigate to the `finish` directory. Next, execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside of Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to the MicroProfile Health Check endpoint at `http://localhost:9080/health`. From
the endpoint, you can see the health of the two services as well as the overall health outcome of the
application. One check shows the state of the `system`
service, and the other shows the state of the `inventory` service. As you might expect, both services are in the `UP` state, and the overall outcome of the application is `UP`.

When you're done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server with the following command:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding health checks to RESTful services
// =================================================================================================

== Adding health checks to RESTful services

Navigate to the `pom.xml` file to check the required dependency. The `microprofile-health-api`
dependency is located in the `start/pom.xml` file. With this dependency, you can
use the MicroProfile Health API to provide health checks to your RESTful services.
The `mpHealth-1.0` feature is enabled in the `start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file.
This feature provides the `http://localhost:9080/health` endpoint to your application.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding a health check to the system service
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding a health check to the system service

Create the `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemHealth.java` class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemHealth.java[tags=SystemHealth]
----

The `org.eclipse.microprofile` package contains the required MicroProfile Health Check classes.

The `@Health` annotation indicates that this class is read to report the state of
a service to the `http://localhost:9080/health` endpoint. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is
required because the health check service must stay active within the lifetime of the application
to report the state.

This class implements the `HealthCheck` interface. Use the interface to override the `call()`
method.

The `system` service self-checks. It reads the system property of the host to report a healthy state.
If the `wlp.server.name` system property is
`defaultServer`, the state is `UP`. Otherwise, the state is `DOWN`.

Lastly, pass the `system` service name as an argument to the `named()`
method to indicate the service that is reported.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding a health check to the inventory service
// =================================================================================================

=== Adding a health check to the inventory service

Create the `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java` class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryHealth.java[tags=InventoryHealth]
----

This service reports a healthy state based on two factors:

1. Configure the provided property of type boolean, which is shown in the following code, in the `resources/CustomConfigSource.json` file. The InventoryConfig object reads the property in this file, which manipulates the state of the service.
```
"io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance": false
```
To learn how to configure the file, see https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[Configuring Microservices using MicroProfile Config].

2. Make sure that the `system` service availability returns a `200` response code. You can add a health check to this service in a similar way to how you added one in the previous section.

Use the `@Inject` annotation to initialize the `InventoryConfig` object. This object allows
you to read the property in the `CustomConfigSource.json` file. Learn more about the
`@Inject` annotation from
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Handling dependencies with RESTful web services].

The `isHealthy()` method returns a boolean that determines the health of the `inventory` service.
This method checks the two previous conditions. The `call()` method uses the `isHealthy()` method as the condition. The state of the `inventory` service is `UP` if the `isHealthy` method returns `true`, but the state is `DOWN`
if `isHealthy` returns `false`.

Now, open the `inventory` service from the `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=InventoryResource]
----

The service invokes the `getPropertiesForHost()` method to display
the system properties for a host name. The host name displays only if you set the
`io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance` configuration to `false`.
Otherwise, the service responds with a `Service is currently in maintenance` message and
a `503` response code. If the service displays the system properties, then
the health of this service is `UP`. If the service is down for maintenance, its health is
`DOWN'. Notice that the second condition in the `isHealthy()` method of the `InventoryHealth` class
relies on the `getPropertiesForHost()` method.

The same conditions apply to the `listContents()` method in this service. This method lists
the stored hosts.

// =================================================================================================
// Building and running the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

To build the application, run the following Maven goal from the command line:
```
  mvn install
```

This goal builds the application and creates a `.war` file in the target directory. The goal also
configures and installs Open Liberty into the `target/liberty/wlp` directory.

Next, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal:
```
  mvn liberty:start-server
```
This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven `pom.xml` file is already configured to
start the application in this server instance.

While the server is running, navigate to the following URL to find the health endpoint
that reports the state of the two services:

* `http://localhost:9080/health`

Now, turn the `inventory` service down to simulate that it is in maintenance or that something went wrong. In
the `resources/CustomConfigSource.json` file, change the
`io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` property value to `true`. Refresh the browser. The state of the
`inventory` service is `DOWN`, so the overall outcome is `DOWN`.
To verify the states, point your browser to the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` inventory service. The service
responds with a message that it is in maintenance.

After you try out your application, go to the `resources/CustomConfigProperties.json` file again. Change the `io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` property from `true` to `false` to set this condition back to its original value.

If you change the code, use the following Maven package goal to rebuild the application.
The Open Liberty server that is running automatically picks up the changes.
```
  mvn package
```

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:
```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

// =================================================================================================
// Testing health checks
// =================================================================================================

== Testing health checks

Write two test methods, `testIfServicesAreUp()` and `testIfInventoryServiceIsDown()`, to
validate the state of the inventory manager application with the `system` and
`inventory` services.

Begin by creating a `start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java` test class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthTest.java[tags=HealthTest]
----

Use the `static` keyword with curly brackets, {}, to initialize the static fields. Static fields include the
`JsonArray` field, which holds the states of the services and the two maps for storing the states when the
services are up and when they are down, and the constant to hold the property that is read.

Place the `@After` annotation on methods that execute after every test case. These methods are
generally used to perform teardown tasks. In this case, the `teardown()` method simply resets
the property value.

A few test case methods include the `@Test` annotation on the test functionality of the inventory
application after you add health checks.

* The `testIfServicesAreUp()` method sends a request to the `http://localhost:9080/health` URL. Next, the method
verifies that the `200` response code is returned. Next, it calls the `connectToHealthEndpoint()` helper method
to read the response as `JsonArray`, which contains the actual states of the two services.
The `JsonArray` response is passed to the `checkServicesStates()` method, which compares and asserts the `JsonArray`
response with the expected `services` states. This method uses the `getActualState()` helper method to return
the actual state of each service from the `JsonArray` response. The expected state for both of the services in
this test is `UP`.

* The `testIfInventoryServiceIsDown()` method follows a procedure similar to the previous test case. The method first checks if the `services` states are `UP`. Next, the
`io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.inventory.inMaintenance` property value is changed from
`false` to `true` in the `CustomConfigSource.json` file. With the property update, the method sends a
request to check the service states again. This time, the expected response code is `503`.
Lastly, the method asserts whether the state of the `inventory` service is `DOWN` and the state of the
`system` service is `UP`.

=== Running the tests

Go to the `start` directory and run the `mvn clean install` command. You see two tests pass with the
following results:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.health.HealthTest
Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.21 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.health.HealthTest
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.169 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest

Results :

Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

To see whether the tests detect a failure, change the values of the tests maps inside the `static` braces, {}.
Rerun the Maven build. You see a test failure occur.
